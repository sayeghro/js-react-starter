# Lab 3 part 1

I created a notes app in React.js and Node.js that uses props and callbacks to
store all note data in the state. I create three components (app, CreateBar, and
Note). It was difficult at first to figure out how exactly to pass props and
execute callback functions correctly, but after a little reading and some
practice, things became clearer and I now understand React and the method of
thinking that it requires far better.

For extra credit, I implemented a snap to grid function, constrained the notes
such that they stay inside the window, and have the zIndex property set the most
recently active notes on top of all the others.
